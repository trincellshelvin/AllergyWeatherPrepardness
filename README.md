# Allergy Weather Preparedness App API

## About Project

This is for all of us allergy suffers out there. It brings into the APP a way to find out your current pollen score and the current Air Quality Index for your area. You will be able to retrieve the current weather data as well all in one place.

The app will also include sort of a checklist for suffers to use to get prepared for weather events. That way they are not going to be in a lurch when it comes to finding open businesses to get what they need (especially for those with a respiratory aliment such as asthma).

## WireFrame

The wireframe breaks down the project of what is to be expected for each page. Unfortunately, it doesn't break down the javascript coding involved in the app's design.
