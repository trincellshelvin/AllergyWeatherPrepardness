# Allergy Weather Preparedness App API

## About Project

This is for all of us allergy suffers out there. It brings into the APP a way to find out your current pollen score and the current Air Quality Index for your area. You will be able to retrieve the current weather data as well all in one place.

The app will also include sort of a checklist for suffers to use to get prepared for weather events. That way they are not going to be in a lurch when it comes to finding open businesses to get what they need (especially for those with a respiratory aliment such as asthma).

## Presentation

Many Americans suffer with some sort of aliment that includes a respiratory issue with their allergies where it be indoor to outdoor, seasonal or not. The Allergy Weather Preparedness app aims to give them a fighting chance to help know any health information to minimize flare ups along with a checklist to get prepared for weather events along with getting the Air Quality for their area and Pollen Count in a location specific output.
