Therefore, AQI levels will remain Good to high-Good.\r\n\r\nFriday, upper-level high pressure over Texas will hinder atmospheric mixing and produce mostly sunny skies across Louisiana. Furthermore, temperatures around 85-90F will promote ozone production, while light westerly to west-southwesterly winds will limit dispersion.
